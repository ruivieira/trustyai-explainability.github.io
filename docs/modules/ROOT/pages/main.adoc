https://trustyai-explainability.github.io/trustyai-site/main/main.html[TrustyAI] is an open source Responsible AI toolkit supported by Red Hat and IBM. TrustyAI provides tools for a variety of responsible AI workflows, such as:

* Local and global model explanations
* Fairness metrics
* Drift metrics
* Text detoxification
* Language model benchmarking
* Language model guardrails

TrustyAI is a default component of https://opendatahub.io/[Open Data Hub] and https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai[Red Hat Openshift AI], and has integrations with projects like https://github.com/kserve/kserve[KServe], https://github.com/caikit/caikit[Caikit], and https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm[vLLM].

== üìñ Glossary üìñ
[horizontal]
XAI::
XAI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to provide clear, understandable explanations of their decisions and actions to human users.
Fairness::
AI fairness refers to the design, development, and deployment of AI systems in a way that ensures they operate equitably and do not include biases or discrimination against any individual or group.
